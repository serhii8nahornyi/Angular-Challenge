# Welcome to Angular Challenge

## Introduction

That's not about comparing which frontend framework to choose, which is better or easier. Everything is pretty easy and difficult at the same time. That's very relative and depends what you compare it to.

There are some points which might be good to know about Angular framework:  
- AngularJS and Angular are different. 
  - AngularJS was released in 2009 and uses Javascript. (old thing like dinosaurs 😄)
  - Angular is a better version of AngularJS and uses Typescript. (That's what the challenge about)
- cross-platform, it allows developing progressive web applications (PWA).
- high-speed performance (I hope even faster than Formula-1 😄)
- Google is originally creator of Angular
- and many more points that are available in the internet.

### This challenge includes something you already might know as well as new stuff for beginners.

I am going to provide you a continuously intensive learning experience which not only inspire but also challenge you in your learning journey with Angular. In order to follow along, you're expected to be equipped with basic JavaScript and TypeScript knowlegde.

## Tools to be used
- any laptop
- NodeJS version 16 and higher
- NX workspace
  - that's awesome mono repository tool which contains and collects everything what we are going to use during web application developing.
  - this tool is not required but too awesome not to use it (from my experience). Whenever I start with a new project I do create it via NX workspace
  - [more detailed about it on the official website: https://nx.dev](https://nx.dev)
